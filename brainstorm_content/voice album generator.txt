Music Album Art Generator

Objective:
  Create a Python application that generates beautiful and unique album covers using metadata from music albums. The application will allow users to input album details and choose from various artistic styles to generate album art.

Features:
  User Input:
    Allow users to input album details such as album name, artist, genre, and release year.
    Optionally, let users upload an image or choose a color palette.
    
  Artistic Styles:
    Provide a selection of artistic styles (e.g., abstract, minimalist, vintage).
    Use libraries like PIL (Python Imaging Library) or OpenCV to apply filters and effects.
    
  Metadata Integration:
    Use a music API (e.g., Spotify API) to fetch album metadata and suggest styles based on genre.
  
  Image Generation:
    Generate album art using the input data and selected style.
    Use libraries like Matplotlib, Pillow, or even AI-based tools like DeepArt or StyleGAN for more advanced effects.
  
  Save and Share:
    Allow users to save the generated album art.
    Provide options to share the artwork on social media or export it in various formats.

  Tools and Libraries:
    Pillow (PIL): For image processing and manipulation.
    Matplotlib/Seaborn: For creating visual elements and patterns.
    Requests: To interact with music APIs.
    Flask/Django (optional): To create a web interface for the application.
    Spotify API or Last.fm API: To fetch album metadata.
