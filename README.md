# About The Project
Our team designed a program called Mood Player, which can combine your current mood and generate your unique BGM in real time! You can even take a selfie with your friends and generate your own BGM!

The theme we want to convey is: that anytime, anywhere, we are always the protagonists of our lives. Each person's emotional experience is unique and flows with changes in time, environment, and even body. Therefore, Mood Player is not only a tool to express emotions, but also an artistic presentation of an individual's "existence" state. In phenomenological philosophy, Heidegger thought that emotion is regarded as a "direct way of being" that is closely linked to the subject's experience. In this way, the individual's present existence is fully manifested.

The reason why we choose the medium of "music" is because we believe that music, as a highly abstract and expressive art form, can break the limitations of speech and seamlessly connect the inner emotions of individuals with the external environment. In the 20th-century art of improvisation, creators created art by interacting with the mood, the environment, and the audience of the moment. Similarly, Mood Player uses real-time mood perception to automatically generate personalized music.

To sum up, Mood Player is not only a picture-to-music generator but also a philosophical exploration of individual emotions, artistic expression and self-realization. By combining emotion with music creation, it offers an opportunity for everyone to constantly discover themselves in their daily lives, so run our program and experience it!
